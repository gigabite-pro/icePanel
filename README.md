IcePanel engineering interview task boilerplate

# How to Run

-   Use `npm i` to install dependencies in both frontend and backend directories.
-   Create a .env file in the backend directory and enter the following `MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://rajmachawal19:o1EqmAt0fHf0kyrg@icepanel.rvo1far.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=IcePanel`
-   Run `npm run dev` in both directories to start the servers.

# Access Data

-   Buttons are available to switch between the `All Requests` page and the `Add New Request` page.
-   Please visit [http://localhost:3000/requests/all](http://localhost:3000/requests/all) to see a detailed view of all the requests.
-   I have added some dummy data to show the `Accepted` and `Rejected` behaviour on the `All Requests` page.

# What have I used?

-   MongoDB Atlas as my primary database to store the requests.
-   Firebase Storage to store the files which returns a public URL to be stored in the Database.
-   Font-Awesome for icons.

# What did I learn?

This was my first time using Vue and Tailwind so I faced a lot of issues to integrate them. Since I know React, I was able to catch up with Vue and create a minimum viable product. I know I took a lot of time but I wanted to submit the best results. Moreover, I learnt to use the `vue-router` to link between different pages.

# Time Estimate

-   I took about 10 hours to complete the whole task.
-   Frontend took about 9 hours since I was not familiar with Vue and Tailwind.
-   Backend took about 1 hour to setup everything and use Typescript to write Express.js code.
