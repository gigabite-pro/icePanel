# How to Run

-   Use `npm i` to install dependencies in both frontend and backend directories.
-   Create a .env file in the backend directory and enter the following `MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://rajmachawal19:o1EqmAt0fHf0kyrg@icepanel.rvo1far.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=IcePanel`
-   Run `npm run dev` in both directories to start the servers.

# What have I used?

-   MongoDB Atlas as my primary database to store the requests.
-   Firebase Storage to store the files which returns a public URL to be stored in the Database.
-   Font-Awesome for icons.

# What did I learn?

This was my first time using Vue and Tailwind so I faced a lot of issues to integrate them. Since I know React, I was able to catch up with Vue and create a minimum viable product. I know I took a lot of time but I wanted to submit the best results.
